The citrusy curd combines perfectly with its buttery and flakey shortbread cookie-crust, which breaks and crumbles with each bite. This recipe is the ultimate lemon bar recipe and the perfect dessert for bringing to parties. They are classy and elegant, while also casual and something you can be proud of making. I made these a while back, and I have wanted to make them again ever since. But, for now, I will teach you how to make these Lemon Bars, so that you can learn to love them as much as I do.<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> This recipe was created on and borrowed from another Blog, <a class="textlink" href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/lemon-bars-recipe/">Sally's Baking Addiction</a>. <br><br> <a href="squares.html">
